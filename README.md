# TQPR10 - LovAr063, NadLa777

This repository comes with both the code and the main thesis for our work.

The repository is organized with separate folders for documents (e.g., the main
thesis work) and one folder with the code. For the thesis, the easiest place to
look is at `docs/article.md` as this is the main article. This is later
converted to LaTeX and compiled for PDF versions. Most of the work will be done
in the Markdown file, however.
