# Half-time seminar

Note that the notes given in this seminar isn't complete, e.g. there may be
stuff that isn't covered that still might need a closer look.

## Ours

Negative results aren't bad, per se.

- CLI-utility gets a bit too much emphasis. Note that it's a good utility to
  use, but note what it actually calculates.
- Figure of the entire structure, e.g. from QRNG to MCU to random number.
- Pseudocode when needed.
- Informal towards the end. Please fix.
- Report at the moment needs some restructuring to help the reader. At the
  moment it's structured to the writer, more or less.
- Be careful about the 10 page limit. We're at 8 pages now, and still have stuff
  to include.
- Note that some editorial notes may be irrelevant due to some minor
  misunderstandings with rates and so forth. Might be worth asking about at a
  later point. Might be the comments about rates.
